# CTEC3905 ASSIGNMENT

PetSits is a website aimed to advertise a pet-boarding service to people who require care for their pets when they are unable to for reasons such as vacation. An API was included at the end of the home page to generate a random picture of a cat everytime the 'refresh' button is clicked.


## Inspiration

My inspiration to create such a website was brought along due to the cats me and my friend had recently adopted which can be seen throughout the website. 


## Content Organisation

For desktop use of the website, I aimed to allow users to fit each full section within their screens to enable them to easily follow information across the website. This was achieved by making content in each section contained within their own rows.
In contrast to this, on mobile, most things were formatted into down through a column however, I ensured that modules of information were small enough to fit the screen. A hamburger menu was implemented within the mobile version that follows as you scroll to reduce it's intrusiveness.
The website consistently follows a green, white and black colour scheme throughout.


## Media

Most of the media across the website has been taken by myself of my cats. All of the icon type of images have been taken from a website (https://icons8.com/icons) and a few cat images have been taken from different links. There are three images as referenced which were created by DALL:E (https://labs.openai.com/), an AI image generator.


# REFERENCES

A small title has been included beside the links to give a very short description of what the references point to. Most of the links are from a website to create icons. Images that were taken by myself have not been referenced. The API used has also been linked.
